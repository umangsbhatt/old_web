<p>I'm currently a junior at Carnegie Mellon majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in software systems. I'm interested in the intersection of machine learning, entrepreneurship, and social good, especially in how entrepreneurs can channel novel ML search to create value in society. I'm also interested in learning more about behaviorial science, medical diagnostics, and vehicle telematics.
<br/>
I also love dancing bhangra, watching the Golden State Warriors dazzle, and volunteering with BAPS.</p>

<p>Currently, I am doing ML interpretability research (specifically for explainable disease diagnosis in emergency rooms) under Professor <a href="http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~moura/" target="_blank">Jos√© Moura</a> and Satwik Kottur. My previous work under Professor <a href="https://zicokolter.com" target="_blank">Zico Kolter</a> leveraged smartphone sensors to crowdsource road condition assessment and later spun off into a startup, <a href="https://percepsense.com" target="_blank">Percepsense</a>. I want to do good with the technologies I build. </p>
