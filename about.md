<p>I'm currently a junior at Carnegie Mellon majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in software systems. I'm interested in the intersection of machine learning, venture, and social good. I'm especially excited by how entrepreneurs can channel novel ML research to start organizations that do good for others. I'm also interested in learning more about behavioral science, medical diagnostics, and vehicle telematics.

<br/>
I also love dancing bhangra (traditional Indian folk dance - watch my team <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMiiWLM7bZ4" target="_blank">here</a>), watching my Atlanta Falcons and Golden State Warriors dazzle, and volunteering with BAPS, a socio-spiritual organization.</p>

<p>Currently, I am doing ML interpretability research (specifically for explainable disease diagnoses in emergency rooms) under Professor <a href="http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~moura/" target="_blank">Jos√© Moura</a> and Satwik Kottur. My previous work under Professor <a href="https://zicokolter.com" target="_blank">Zico Kolter</a> leveraged smartphone sensors to crowdsource road condition assessment and later spun off into a startup, <a href="https://percepsense.com" target="_blank">Percepsense</a>. I want to do good with the technologies I build. </p>
