I'm going to miss my fellow Groupers after a wonderful summer in Chicago. Interning at Groupon was a phenomenal learning experience that gave me a strong understanding of how, when, and why to ship a product. At the same time, I was able to channel my inner data nerd to ruminate upon how to implement time-sensitive personalized pricing, thinking not only about technical limitations of but also about business implications of such a feature. I spent my time in the e-commerce world building personalized dynamic pricing models and driving merchant supply intelligence -- I loved every second of it.
